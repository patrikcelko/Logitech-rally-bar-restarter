# Logitech-rally-bar-restarter

Logitech rally bar likes to jam after some time in sleep, and the easiest solution is to restart it from time to time. However, it usually requires some human to do it...

This program written in Python helps to automate this routine. Even can be called periodically using some kind of CRON. So feel free to use it to improve your life :)
